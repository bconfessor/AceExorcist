# AceExorcist
Card game designed during the GGJ 2016, later implemented by myself.


This project was originally developed in Global Game Jam(GGJ) 2016. 
We had few available programmers and more artists and the team decided to make a card game.
Because of this, at the time, the team focused mainly on the cards' art and the game rules, with only the early coding actually being done.

After the Game Jam, I took it upon myself to see this through as my very first extracurricular Unity project. 
After two months of learning to code in Unity, I managed to develop a turn-based system that implemented the game rules that we had decided at the GGJ.


## Instructions

The Windows executable game file can be found under AceExorcist/AceExorcist.exe .
